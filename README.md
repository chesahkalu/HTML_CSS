# The Difference :
### HTML: :wrench: :hammer:
In simpler terms, think of HTML as the building blocks of a webpage. It's like a set of instructions that tells web browsers how to display different elements,
such as text, paragraphs, heading, images, and videos, on a page. 
### CSS: :rainbow:
In simpler terms, think of CSS as the "stylist" for your webpage. It's what makes your webpage look visually appealing and well-designed.
CSS works by specifying rules for how different HTML elements should be displayedâ€”using, for example, fonts or colors.

## HTML pointers :
* [RESSET](./resset.css) : Every web browser has its own default styles for different elements. How `Google Chrome` renders headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth may be different from how `Internet Explorer` does. To ensure cross-browser `compatibility`, it is a good practice to implement a `resset` of all parts and elements of your html to a `uniform` basic raw form , before implementing your actuall `css` styling. 
This file contains the popular `Eric Meyer's` css resset code, which would be linked in the `head` element of your HTML code, to resset every other values of each element to
a uniform font,colour,size etc. 

* SEMANTIC_CODE : Dessist from styling, colouring or adding fonts to your page using HTML, that is the job of `css`. HTML should be the carrier of the page content structured properly with the proper elements and tools. This gives an ideal interpretation of the content , meaning and usage of the page to both the computer and human users. 

* [SPECIAL_CHARACTER](./special_char_link.txt) : Special characters include various punctuation marks, accented letters, and symbols. When typed directly into HTML, they can be misunderstood or mistaken for the wrong character by either the computer or human; thus they need to be encoded. In this file is a link with a long list of characters and their direct codes.

* HIEARACHY and INDENTATION : HTML elements are hierarchical, which means that they can be nested inside each other to create a tree-like structure of the content on the web page. Code should be well-formed and properly indented, with each element on its own line and each level of hierarchy indented by one level. This makes the code easier to read and understand, and can help to avoid errors.
