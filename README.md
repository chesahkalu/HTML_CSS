# The Difference :
### HTML: :wrench: :hammer:
In simpler terms, think of HTML as the building blocks of a webpage. It's like a set of instructions that tells web browsers how to display different elements,
such as text, paragraphs, heading, images, and videos, on a page. 
### CSS: :rainbow:
In simpler terms, think of CSS as the "stylist" for your webpage. It's what makes your webpage look visually appealing and well-designed.
CSS works by specifying rules for how different HTML elements should be displayedâ€”using, for example, fonts or colors.

## HTML pointers :
[resset.css](./resset.css) : Every web browser has its own default styles for different elements. How `Google Chrome` renders headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth may be different from how `Internet Explorer` does. To ensure cross-browser `compatibility`, it is a good practice to implement a `resset` of all parts and elements of your html to a `uniform` basic raw form , before implementing your actuall `css` styling. 
This file contains the popular `Eric Meyer's` css resset code, which would be linked in the `head` element of your HTML code, to resset every other values of each element to
a uniform font,colour,size etc. 

* semantic_code : Dessist from styling, colouring or adding fonts to your page using HTML, that is the job of `css`. HTML should be the carrier of the page content structured properly with the proper elements and tools. This gives an ideal interpretation of the content , meaning and usage of the page to both the computer and human users.
