# The Difference :
### HTML: :wrench: :hammer:
In simpler terms, think of HTML as the building blocks of a webpage. It's like a set of instructions that tells web browsers how to display different elements,
such as text, images, and videos, on a page. 
### CSS: :rainbow:
In simpler terms, think of CSS as the "stylist" for your webpage. It's what makes your webpage look visually appealing and well-designed.
CSS works by specifying rules for how different HTML elements should be displayed.
